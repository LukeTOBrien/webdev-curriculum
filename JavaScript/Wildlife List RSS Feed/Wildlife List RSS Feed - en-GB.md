            <title>Peregrine falcon</title>
            <description>
                Peregrine falcons are one of, if not the, fastest animals in the world. They are believed to achieve speeds of over 300 kph when plunging from the sky after prey. This iconic bird of prey is also one of the world's most widely distributed birds, found on every continent except Antarctica. Peregrines prefer open landscapes, but are increasingly exploiting towns and cities where there are tall buildings for nesting and plenty of pigeons for prey. Unlucky victims are captured in vicious talons after a lightning dive from above, but the killing stroke is delivered by the deadly beak.
