# Editors

All lessons have been created using a basic text editor, this keeps the lessons nice and simple without confussing students with unessasery features, nothing more advanced then this is required.

The following is a list of recommended simple editors the can be used with this lesson series:
+ Notepad
+ Notepad++ (Advised) [Downloaded from here](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
+ Visual Studio Code [Downloaded from here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

I would advise you to use Notepad++ in teaching these lessons to your student as it is nice and simple and allows for many files to be opened in tabs, so in later lessons of the series, multiple files can be dealt with easily.

This lesson series has been written using the Visual Studio Code editor, this is because it has some useful features the make it easier.<br>
Please feel free to download Visual Stdio Code and try using it, if you feel that it would suit your student.<br>
If you do download Visual Studio Code then one extension that is a must have is [tag-autocomplete]()
