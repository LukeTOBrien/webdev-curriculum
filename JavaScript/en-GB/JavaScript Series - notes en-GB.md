#Introduction:
In this project, children will learn the basic concepts of progamming through the use of JavaScript by displaying a simle list of Farm Animals.

#Online Resources

We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write HTML & CSS online. This project contains the following trinkets:

+ ['Farm Animals List' starting point -- jumpto.cc/web-robot](http://jumpto.cc/web-robot)

Children can also make use of this blank trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-blank)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-blank) to write their own HTML & CSS, or alternatively they can use this template trinket [(jumpto.cc/trinket-template)](http://jumpto.cc/trinket-template).

There is also a trinket containing a sample solution to the challenges:

+ ['Farm Animals List' Finished](https://trinket.io/html/00736c0e18)

#Offline Resources
This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/webdev-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ template/Template.html
+ template/style.css
+ robot/Robot.html
+ robot/style.css
+ Lots of .png images

You can also find a completed version of this project's challenges in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ robot-finished/RobotFinished.html
+ robot-finished/style.css
+ Lots of .png images

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

# Editors
All lessons have been created using a basic text editor, this keeps the lessons nice and simple without confussing students with unessasery features, nothing more advanced then this is required.

The following is a list of recommended simple editors the can be used with this lesson series:
+ Notepad
+ Notepad++ (Advised) [Downloaded from here]()
+ Visual Studio Code [Downloaded from here]()

I would advise you to use Notepad++ in teaching these lessons to your student as it is nice and simple and allows for many files to be opened in tabs, so in later lessons of the series, multiple files can be dealt with easily.

This lesson series has been written using the Visual Studio Code editor, this is because it has some useful features the make it easier.<br>
Please feel free to download Visual Stdio Code and try using it, if you feel that it would suit your student.<br>
If you do download Visual Studio Code then one extension that is a must have is [tag-autocomplete]()
